# User's Guide to Calculus in R^n

## Goals of this project

⋅⋅* Give a rigorous exposition of Calculus in R^n
⋅⋅* Give a reigorous treatment of differential forms
⋅⋅* Give a rigorous treatment of exterior derivative
⋅⋅* Give a rigorous treatment of dx in integration
⋅⋅* Give a rigorous treatment of smooth functions

## Broad outlines

The broad outline of this project is to get the reader to the point where they can comfortably undertake a rigorous study of the contents of the books

1. Differential topology by Guillemin and Pollack
2. Introduction to Smooth Manifolds by John Lee
3. Differential Forms in Algebraic Topology by Bott & Tu
