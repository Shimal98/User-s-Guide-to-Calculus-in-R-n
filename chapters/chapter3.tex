\section{Integration in $\mathbb{R}^1$}
	
	For an \textbf{excellent} treatment of Riemann Integration in $\mathbb{R}^1$ using Darboux sums (which make computing the upper and lower integral sums easier) see \cite{math310notes}. We list a bevy of results that are extremely useful in using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus rigorously.
	
	\begin{theorem}
		Let $f : [a, b] \to \mathbb{R}$. If $f \in C\left( [a, b]\right)$, then $f \in R\left( [a, b]\right)$. (In words if $f$ is continuous on $[a, b]$ then $f$ is Riemann integrable on $[a, b]$).
	\end{theorem}
